Hi! I'm a data scientist and math enthusiast. Check out my portafolio for some cool projects, and take a look at my blog if you would like to read more.

Before transitioning to data science, I received a B.S. in Mathematics and a Ph.D in Civil Engineering. My primary field of study was numerical methods for geomorphology and coastal engineering. Here is a list of my peer-reviewed [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=N08QGhsAAAAJ&hl=en).

In my spare time, I enjoy photography, especially [underwater photography](https://www.sealoving.com). I'm also certified to dive with and without a tank (SCUBA/freediving).

### In My Toolbox
Python, Matlab, SQL, JAVA  
Machine Learning
Delft3D, ArcGIS, Excel, Tableau, Photoshop
Underwater and Aerial photography
