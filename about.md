Hi there! Thanks for visiting my site.  

I'm a data scientist and math enthusiast. Check out my [portfolio](https://sealoving.github.io/portfolio/) for some cool projects, or my [blog](https://sealoving.github.io/) to read more.

Before transitioning to data science, I received a B.S. in Mathematics from Peking University, and a Ph.D in Civil Engineering from the University of Minnesota. My primary academic field of study was numerical methods for geomorphology and coastal engineering. To know more about the models I developed and their applications, check out my [peer-reviewed publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=N08QGhsAAAAJ&hl=en).

In my spare time, I enjoy photography and outdoor activities. As a certified SCUBA diver and freediver (diving without a tank), I have had amazing experiences doing [underwater photography](https://www.sealoving.com).

### In my toolbox
Python, Matlab, SQL, html, JavaScript, Flask, D3 
Machine Learning, Geomorphology, Computational Fluid Dynamics, Hydrology  
ArcGIS, Delft3D, Excel, Photoshop  
Underwater and Aerial photography
