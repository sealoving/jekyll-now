What are the most important features that distinguish edible mushrooms from the poisonous ones? Even a perfect dataset can be compromised by human perception. How do we choose a classifier with that in mind? 



### Mushroom Foraging

> "All mushrooms are edible. But some you can eat only once."

This is a quote from my colleague Natalia
My husband and I moved to the Pacific northwest about a year ago. Influenced by a few relatives who are experienced mushroom foragers, we also started to identify and collect mushrooms during our hikes.  While it's mostly for fun, I do hope that one day,some tasty ones will make their way to our dinner table. We have a couple of books that we try to remember to bring with us to the field,

When I saw the mushroom dataset in the UCI machine learning repository, I was certainly interested in what data says about the edibility of mushrooms.
