I'm a data scientist who enjoys solving problems with math and programming. Check out my [resume](https://sealoving.github.io/resume/) for some past and ongoing projects, or my [blog](https://sealoving.github.io/) to read more.

I received a B.S. in Information and Computing Science from the Department of Mathematics of Peking University, and a Ph.D in Civil Engineering from the University of Minnesota. My PhD research focused on developing numerical and statistical models for understanding pattern formation in nature, especially patterns that involve fluid and sediment motion. You can find more details in my peer-reviewed [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=N08QGhsAAAAJ&hl=en).

In my spare time, I enjoy photography and outdoor activities. As a certified SCUBA diver and freediver (diving without a tank), I have had amazing experiences doing [underwater photography](https://www.sealoving.com).

## In my toolbox
Python, Matlab, SQL, html, JavaScript, Flask, D3, MongoDB   
Machine Learning, Geomorphology, Computational Fluid Dynamics, Hydrology  
ArcGIS, Delft3D, Excel, Photoshop  
Underwater and Aerial photography
