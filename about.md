Hi! I'm a data scientist and math enthusiast, with years of experience in geomorphology and coastal engineering. Check out my portafolio for some cool projects, and take a look at my blog if you would like to read more!

In my spare time, I enjoy photography, especially [underwater photography](https://www.sealoving.com).
